### Summary
Digital transformation refers to the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how the business operates and delivers value to customers. In the context of systems engineering, digital transformation involves the use of digital technologies to design, develop, and operate systems more efficiently and effectively.

Some examples of how digital transformation can impact systems engineering include:

1.  Improved design and development: Digital tools and techniques can be used to design and develop systems more quickly and accurately, reducing the time and cost of development.
    
2.  Enhanced simulation and testing: Digital simulation tools can be used to test and evaluate the performance of systems in a virtual environment, reducing the need for physical testing and prototyping.
    
3.  Increased automation and integration: Digital technologies can be used to automate and integrate different parts of the systems engineering process, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of errors.
    
4.  Enhanced monitoring and control: Digital technologies can be used to monitor and control systems in real-time, allowing for timely adjustments and better performance.
    

Overall, digital transformation can help systems engineering teams to be more productive, efficient, and effective in their work, resulting in improved systems and better outcomes for businesses and customers.
