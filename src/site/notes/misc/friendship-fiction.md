Friendship - Fiction

The following conversation took place online.

“Oh shit, I fucked up.”

“What happened?”

“I fucking dropped the tv.”

“Oh shit. Is it broken?”

“I dunno, let me turn it on and see.”

“LOL. Don’t get electrocuted.”

Note: “LOL” denotes that the conversant is laughing out loud.

It is 4:32 pm, and Cameron has been awake for approximate 14 minutes, which, as he just learned, is plenty of time to get into trouble. He awoke with more energy than he should have, considering he spent the entire night playing a new online video game he recently purchased, along with a Playstation 2 to play it on. The condition of his room, if described, would include the word “shambles,” and he realizes that cleaning up is probably in order. Wires stretch from a completely full power strip to a computer, two Playstations and two television sets (that he and his good friend Lucas had previously used to adventure together in the same online game), which some might liken to a writhing mass of snakes worthy of an Indiana Jones film. Aside from this fire hazard, the room is littered with cans of Code Red (the prime fuel for video gaming), empty Cheetos bags, and a week’s worth of dirty laundry. Rolling off his bed, Cameron surveys his surroundings and becomes a bit disgusted by the relative squalor.

His first task is to cart his parents large, black, 35-inch TV back to its usual spot in the den. His parents would soon be returning from their respective jobs, and would likely want to catch up on the murders, suicide bombings, rescued cats, plane crashes, and average-people-making-a-difference-in-the-lives-of-needy-children that the last twenty-four hours had brought. After shoveling the clothes and aluminum cans, clearing a path between the small, fiberglass TV-cart and his bedroom door, he braces himself on the newly excavated, thick, tan carpet and begins to pull. This is where he runs into difficulty. Instead of scooting along the carpet like a good TV-cart should, it simply topples over. Cameron’s attempts to catch the black, plastic behemoth are in vain, and he jumps out of the way just in time to avoid having his left foot crushed under its weight.

“It made a freaking loud noise,” Cameron says to Lucas as they drive down the dark, gravel perimeter road of the airport. Indeed, when the TV fell, it sounded like a walrus being shot from a cannon, if you can imagine that.

“So, what, it doesn’t work at all?” Lucas asks, staring past the airport fence towards the rotating beacons atop the small control towers, as the aging, blue car jostles and squeaks over the poorly-kept road.

“Well, it works, but instead of displaying colors normally, there’s a huge rainbow across the screen.” Cameron says grimly.

“So what did your parents say about their new rainbow-matic display?” Lucas retorts lightly, as the car hits another pothole.

“They weren’t mad at all.”

“Your parents are so weird like that. They don’t get mad at anything.”

“It’s true, but I feel awful. Good thing I have this job.”

“You’ll be mad banking as soon as we get paid.”

“Yeah, and then I’ll buy them a new, and better, TV.”

Cameron and Lucas pull up to the third warehouse on the left, buzz in and drive past the cranking, rusted gate that can never quite open all the way.

“Ready for another five nights of sitting on our asses?” Lucas exclaims jovially, as they walk through a small, dark office and into the Restricted Area of Security Alarm Monitoring Unlimited.

“My favorite is filling out the scraps of paper all night. I can’t wait to feed them all through the fax machine one by one, and then shred them.” Cameron replies, not bothering to mask his sarcasm, but making sure his voice is low enough so as not to let Mary, the supervisor (whose ass was so wide she often sits in two chairs at once), overhear. It had only been a week, but Cameron already hated his job. Overall, it’s not a terribly bad job. It was easy to get, as Lucas, who worked there previously, only had to put a good word in for him. They had ample time to read and play their GameBoy Advances, and hardly any alarms went off in the middle of the night, but… it was just that… well, here are a few things: 1) the other four employees have a combined IQ of seventy-five, a pitiful grasp of the English language, and smell like a variety of putrid substances and fluids, 2) he spent the previous week training himself, with the covert help of Lucas, since the junior supervisor (an eighteen year old high school drop-out who answers every question with the same idiotically blank stare) frankly didn’t know shit, 3) he spent a third of the night rubbing sponges against printer ribbons purchased in 1975, since one of the aforementioned employees had recently broken the machine which was supposed to complete this process automatically.

Cameron only found joy in the fact that Lucas was there to share his pain, and at 7:15, when the night shift ended, they could drive off into the morning and insult their coworkers and the tasks they had been assigned until their breath had been exhausted. Oh, and the fact that he would get a nice paycheck in two weeks. He really needed it.

“Cameron, I need to talk to you.” Mary says, as Cameron walks across the perpetually creaking tiled floor to his usual spot at Terminal #3, one of the few that didn’t appear to be encrusted with food, or other, vaguely similar substances. He glances at Lucas, who seats himself at the opposite terminal, and their eyes transmitted wonder, as well as slight fear, about whether this has to do with the previous day’s prank calls they made to the company’s 1-800 number. Cameron attempted a smile, but only half of his face would cooperate. He wasn’t really worried, since he was relatively certain the company did not have caller ID, but he was still unsure about what Mary could want with him.

Cameron follows her and the three hams she must have been stashing in the seat of her pants, and sits facing her at the flimsy, glass-topped patio table that furnishes the break room.

“We’re going to have to let you go.” Mary said seriously.

_What. The. Fuck_ reverberates in Cameron’s brain. He hadn’t seen this coming. “Oh,” is all he manages to say, staring blankly at Mary’s sagging and acne-scarred face, noticing for the first time that she has a mustache.

“We over-hired. I’m sorry, I tried to get you switched to another shift, but they were full, too.” She says, breathlessly. Cameron can’t judge her sincerity.

“Did you and Lucas drive here together?” She asks.

“Yes, I drove him.”

“Well, let me call him in and see if he can get a ride home in the morning.”

He couldn’t, and so Mary allowed him to leave with Cameron and take the day off.

“This is total BULLSHIT!” Lucas exclaims, as they drive away. “What the hell are they thinking? How can they just fire you like that? It’s bullshit.”

“Yeah” was all Cameron could manage.

“In the morning I’m going to call Mr. Henry and find out what the hell happened.” Mr. Henry was the owner of the company, and Lucas’s neighbor and former baseball coach. Cameron didn’t have much faith that calling would do anything, but he didn’t want to stop Lucas.

“Man, that is so UNFAIR!” Lucas continues. Cameron knows Lucas is right, but he is nevertheless relieved. Even after a week of work, he already dreaded spending the entire summer working there. His pressing monetary issues wont hit him until his next credit card bill comes in the mail.

“There’s nothing we can do about it now,” Cameron says consolingly, “let’s just go play games.”

“Okay, and then I’m going to call Mr. Henry and find out what the hell happened.”

“Sure.”

When Lucas called, all he found out was that the company had indeed over-hired (or so Mr. Henry said), and on top of that, that Mary had claimed Lucas had walked out without her permission (lying bitch), although strangely, he wasn’t fired, and so spent the rest of the summer working night shift by himself. Cameron, on the other hand, never managed to find another job, and so couldn’t replace his parents TV. Strangely, his parents didn’t seem to mind. They simply set it to black and white, which solved the rainbow problems. He still felt guilty every time it was switched on, though.
